Visual Recent Changes
=========

Visual Recent Changes is a ClojureScript + HTML5 canvas visualization mini-project. When finished, it can hopefully be used as a way to demystify two things:
- the frequency at which edits to different language versions of Wikipedia are happening, and
- the way that core.async asynchronously consumes and processes this data.

Right now, it's mostly a few lines of ClojureScript that consume pre-configured websocket data. Figuring out a way to meaningfully translate this into visual data is my next task.
